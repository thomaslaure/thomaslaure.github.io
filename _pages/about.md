I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, in the Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris Nord ([LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/)), within the [LoCal](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/local-logique-et-calcul/) (Logic and Computation) team. I am working under the supervision of  [Micaela Mayero](https://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mayero/) and [Flavien Breuvart](https://www.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~breuvart/?lang=uk) since October 2025.

I am interested in logic, type theory, category theory. My PhD topic is more precisely linked with graded (co-)monads and (co-)effects.

Before this, I was a student at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris.
