I am a PhD student at Universit√© Sorbonne Paris Nord, working under the supervision of  [Micaela Mayero](https://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mayero/) and [Flavien Breuvart](https://www.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~breuvart/?lang=uk) since October 2025.

I am interested in logic, type theory, category theory. My PhD topic is more precisely linked with graded (co-)monads and (co-)effects.
